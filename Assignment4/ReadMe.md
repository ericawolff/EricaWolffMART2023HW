Explain how web browsers function
A web browser functions because of multiple components, including: a web interface, a rendering engine (responsible for the visual representation of the web page), the browser engine, the network, programming language and interpreter, and data storage. Firstly, the rendering engine reads the HTML and constructs a DOM content tree. A render tree is then constructed, and then goes through a layout process where each node is positioned with coordinates, and then traversed. The user is then able to interact with the nodes. 

Define and describe DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface to a document and stipulates how that document is accessed and changed by defining its structure in a logical way. The DOM represents these documents as nodes and objects on a tree structure so that programming languages such as JavaScript can modify the content. The DOM is an interface to an HTML document. It is used by browsers as a first step towards determining what to render in the viewport, and by Javascript programs to modify the content, structure, or styling of the page.

What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML?
HTML functions as the foundation and structure of a page’s content; it describes document nodes. It can be modified after it is set.

XML describes document as opposed to displaying them.

XHTML is very similar to HTML, but meet more precise, rigorous standards in order to function properly. It also has some similar aspects to XML.

What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need?
Document, root, title, body.

What is the index.html page for? Where does it go?
The index is a master HTML file that almost every website has. It’s like the “homepage.”

Similar to READMEs and GitHub, when a URL is passed to a browser that does not specify a file, the browser automatically “looks for” and requests a index.html from the host server.

Review: What are some of the best naming practices?
Using a root folder (named root) and staying organized.
Being concise when naming folders, and following standard/reccomended practices, such as those involving capitalization and NO spaces. Don’t use funky characters, and use extensions.
